      <h2>India Prepares for Major Heatwave as Temperatures Soar Across the Country</h2>

      <!-- sub title -->
      <h3>Meteorological Department Issues Warnings and Advisories</h3>

      <!-- para 1 -->
      <p>India is bracing for an intense heatwave as meteorological authorities warn that several states are likely to experience extreme temperatures above 45°C in the coming days. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued alerts for states including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, and Odisha, emphasizing the risks to human health, agriculture, and water resources. Experts caution that heatwaves of this magnitude can be fatal, especially for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and outdoor workers.</p>
      
      <!-- para 2 -->
      <p>Heatwave conditions are already being observed in parts of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, with temperatures exceeding 44°C in multiple districts. Medical authorities have reported an increase in heatstroke and dehydration cases in hospitals, with temporary emergency care units being set up in affected cities. The IMD has also noted that the current heatwave is more intense due to a combination of high humidity, low rainfall during the pre-monsoon season, and delayed monsoon onset.</p>
		
      <!-- para 3 -->
      <p>In response, the central and state governments have issued advisories urging citizens to stay indoors during peak afternoon hours, maintain proper hydration, and avoid strenuous outdoor activity. Schools in several districts have temporarily reduced hours or shifted to online classes to protect children from the intense heat. Public health campaigns are focusing on recognizing early signs of heat exhaustion and promoting the use of cooling centers.</p>

      <!-- para 4 -->
      <p>Agriculture, a sector particularly vulnerable to extreme heat, is facing serious challenges. Crop fields, particularly wheat and pulses, are under stress due to prolonged high temperatures, risking yield reduction. Farmers are being advised to irrigate fields efficiently and adopt heat-resistant crop varieties where possible. The government has also announced emergency support measures, including water distribution, subsidies for irrigation, and crop insurance assistance for affected regions.</p>
      
      <!-- para 5 -->
      <p>Urban areas are facing additional difficulties due to the urban heat island effect, where concrete and asphalt surfaces trap heat, raising local temperatures further. Electricity demand has surged as households and businesses rely heavily on air conditioning and cooling systems. Power utilities have issued guidelines for rotational load management to prevent blackouts, while citizens are encouraged to use electricity responsibly to reduce stress on the grid.</p>

      <!-- para 6 -->
      <p>Public transportation and outdoor workers are also at risk. Authorities have advised construction workers, traffic police, and delivery personnel to follow heat safety protocols, including taking breaks in shaded areas and wearing protective clothing. Several cities have opened hydration stations in public spaces to provide drinking water for workers and the general population. NGOs and volunteer organizations are contributing by distributing water bottles and raising awareness about heat-related health risks.</p>

      <!-- para 7 -->
      <p>The IMD has emphasized that the heatwave is likely to continue for the next 7–10 days, with some regions experiencing night-time temperatures that provide little relief. Citizens are urged to stay informed via weather updates and adhere to safety measures issued by local authorities. Hospitals and health departments are on high alert, ready to respond to an expected rise in heat-related emergencies.</p>

      <!-- para 8 -->
      <p>Experts stress the long-term need for climate adaptation measures to deal with increasingly frequent and severe heatwaves. Urban planning that incorporates green spaces, efficient water management, and public cooling centers can help reduce the impact of extreme temperatures. Awareness campaigns, early warning systems, and coordinated government action remain crucial to protect lives and livelihoods during these extreme weather events.</p>
