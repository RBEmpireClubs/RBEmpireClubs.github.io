      <h2>India’s Economy Shows Resilience Amid Global Uncertainties</h2>

      <!-- sub title -->
      <h3>Government and Businesses Strategize for Sustainable Growth</h3>

      <!-- para 1 -->
      <p>India’s economy continues to demonstrate resilience despite global uncertainties, including rising inflation, fluctuating oil prices, and international trade tensions. Recent data from the Ministry of Finance indicates that India’s GDP growth for 2025–26 is projected at 6.1%, making it one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. Analysts attribute this growth to strong domestic consumption, robust services sector performance, and government policies supporting manufacturing and investment.</p>
      
      <!-- para 2 -->
      <p>The government has introduced several initiatives to bolster economic growth. Programs like Make in India 2.0, Startup India, and the National Infrastructure Pipeline aim to attract investment, generate employment, and enhance industrial output. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted that improving ease of doing business and streamlining regulatory processes will encourage both domestic and foreign investment, boosting long-term economic stability.</p>
		
      <!-- para 3 -->
      <p>In the banking and financial sector, digitalization is transforming service delivery. Mobile banking, UPI transactions, and online lending platforms have expanded access to credit for small businesses and entrepreneurs. Analysts note that increased financial inclusion has strengthened consumer spending, providing a stable foundation for economic growth. Additionally, measures to curb non-performing assets in banks have improved the overall health of the financial system.</p>

      <!-- para 4 -->
      <p>The stock market has shown resilience, with benchmark indices like Nifty 50 and Sensex reaching new highs. Investors remain optimistic due to strong corporate earnings, favorable government policies, and foreign portfolio investment inflows. Sectors such as IT services, pharmaceuticals, and renewable energy are particularly attracting attention, reflecting India’s shifting focus toward technology-driven and sustainable industries.</p>
      
      <!-- para 5 -->
      <p>Inflationary pressures remain a concern, particularly in food and fuel prices. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has maintained a balanced approach, adjusting policy rates cautiously to ensure price stability without compromising growth. Analysts emphasize that controlling inflation is critical to maintaining consumer confidence, sustaining purchasing power, and ensuring equitable economic development across income groups.</p>

      <!-- para 6 -->
      <p>Employment generation and skill development are central to the government’s economic strategy. Programs like Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) and industry-linked training initiatives aim to equip the workforce with skills aligned to modern industry requirements. Economists argue that human capital development is key to sustaining long-term economic growth and supporting India’s position as a global investment hub.</p>

      <!-- para 7 -->
      <p>International trade remains a vital driver of India’s economic performance. Export growth in sectors like pharmaceuticals, electronics, and textiles has provided a buffer against global uncertainties. Trade agreements and diplomatic engagement with countries in Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East are expected to further enhance market access for Indian products, boosting both exports and foreign investment inflows.</p>

      <!-- para 8 -->
      <p>Looking ahead, India’s economic outlook appears promising yet cautious. While domestic consumption, infrastructure investment, and technological adoption continue to support growth, policymakers and businesses must remain vigilant against global shocks, inflationary pressures, and sectoral imbalances. Coordinated efforts between government, industry, and financial institutions are essential to sustain robust, inclusive, and resilient economic growth in the coming years.</p>
