      <h2>India Pushes Forward on Green Energy Transition</h2>

      <!-- sub title -->
      <h3>Government ramps up solar, wind, and hydrogen projects to meet 2070 net-zero targets while addressing energy security and climate challenges.</h3>

      <!-- para 1 -->
      <p>India, one of the world’s fastest-growing economies and third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is intensifying its focus on renewable energy as part of its climate commitments. With the ambitious pledge of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, the country is rapidly expanding solar, wind, and green hydrogen projects to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and ensure long-term energy security. The government’s recent policies, combined with private sector investments, are driving India toward becoming a global leader in clean energy innovation.</p>
      
      <!-- para 2 -->
      <p>According to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, India has already installed over 180 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity, which includes solar, wind, small hydro, and biomass. This figure represents nearly 43% of the nation’s total installed power capacity. Solar power leads the way, with vast projects spread across states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The government’s target is to achieve 500 GW of renewable capacity by 2030, a goal that, while challenging, is seen as both achievable and necessary to reduce carbon intensity.</p>
		
      <!-- para 3 -->
      <p>One of the key components of India’s energy transition is the National Hydrogen Mission, which seeks to establish the country as a global hub for green hydrogen production. Hydrogen, produced through renewable-powered electrolysis, is seen as a game-changer for industries such as steel, cement, and fertilizers, which are traditionally hard to decarbonize. Experts believe that by scaling up hydrogen production, India can cut industrial emissions while also becoming a major exporter of clean fuel in the future.</p>
      
      <!-- para 4 -->
      <p>Wind energy, though slightly slower in growth compared to solar, continues to play an important role. Coastal states like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat are leveraging their geographical advantage to expand wind farms. The government is also looking into offshore wind projects, with initial plans to install 30 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030. Such projects, while technically complex and costly, could significantly boost India’s renewable mix and complement solar production, especially during nighttime.</p>
      
      <!-- para 5 -->
      <p>Despite the progress, challenges remain. Financing large-scale renewable projects requires billions of dollars in investment, and while foreign investors are showing interest, policy stability and infrastructure readiness are key factors. Transmission infrastructure, particularly the ability to move clean energy from resource-rich regions to industrial hubs, is a major bottleneck. The government is working on a “Green Energy Corridor” to strengthen transmission lines and reduce energy losses.</p>

      <!-- para 6 -->
      <p>Energy storage solutions are also emerging as a critical priority. Solar and wind are intermittent by nature, and without efficient storage systems, power reliability becomes an issue. India is investing in large-scale battery projects and pumped hydro storage to ensure round-the-clock availability of renewable energy. Domestic manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries, supported under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, is also expected to boost self-reliance and reduce import dependency.</p>

      <!-- para 7 -->
      <p>Environmental experts have welcomed India’s transition but emphasize that community participation and ecological balance must not be overlooked. Large-scale solar parks, for example, require vast tracts of land, sometimes leading to disputes over agricultural land and biodiversity concerns. Policymakers are now exploring decentralized solar projects, including rooftop installations and solar pumps for farmers, which not only reduce ecological impact but also empower rural households with clean electricity.</p>

      <!-- para 8 -->
      <p>India’s push toward green energy is not just about meeting climate commitments; it is also about positioning itself as a global leader in the clean energy economy of the future. With growing domestic demand, strong policy backing, and a rising pool of clean-tech entrepreneurs, India is set to play a decisive role in shaping the world’s energy transition. If the current momentum is maintained, the country could achieve its 2030 renewable targets and lay a solid foundation for a sustainable, low-carbon future.</p>
